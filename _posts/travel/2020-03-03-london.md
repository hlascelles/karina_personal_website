High idea density. A perfect mix of energy, architecture, science, art and entrepreneurship; a mix of big city vibes, historic villages and expansive green spaces. Many things to see and do for free. I believe London is the best place in the world.

### 1. Events

* [Open House Festival](https://open-city.org.uk/open-house-festival-2024) in **September** - celebration of London’s housing, architecture and neighbourhoods. Best stuff requires booking and it gets very competitive; sign up for their newsletter to find out when the bookings open. But even if you have no bookings, it is always a fun weekend - visit architect offices (for example Allies & Morrison doesn't require bookings), try to tag along for walking tours from King's Cross visitor center, explore parts of London further away from the center where things are less busy.
* [London Gallery Weekend](https://londongalleryweekend.art/) in **May/June** - a weekend when private art galleries open to the public, a great opportunity to visit many galleries with no expectation of buying anything. My favourites include Maddox Gallery, Gagosian (Grosvenor Hill), Waddington Custot, Thaddaeus Ropac, Gazelli Art House, Galerie Max Hetzler, White Cube Mason's Yard and Bowman Sculpture. This weekend is also a great opportunity to visit Christie's London (King Street) and Sotheby's London (New Bond Street).
* Isabella Plantation in Richmond Park - visit in **late April/early May** to catch rhododendrons in bloom (explore all 3 ponds). Also find the deer with huge antlers in Richmond Park.
* [The Canary Wharf Winter Lights Festival](https://canarywharf.com/whats-on/) in **January** (evenings).
* [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/events/london) in **mid-late May**.
* If you are in London on Saturday morning, join in for one of the many [ParkRuns](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/events/events/#geo=9.26/51.4634/-0.1734).
<nbsp></nbsp>
* Check [Secret London](https://secretldn.com/) and [Londonist](https://londonist.com/things-to-do) for lists of events on a specific week.

### [2. London neighbourhoods](/travel/london-parts/) 
I very roughly divided London into [25 parts](/travel/london-parts/) and listed my favourite things to do, see and eat in each of them.

### 3. Museums, exhibitions and art (mostly free)

* [The British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions-events) and their [Lates](https://www.britishmuseum.org/visit/late-opening-on-fridays).

### 5. Gardens and parks
* [Kew Gardens](https://www.kew.org/kew-gardens/whats-on) - one of the best botanical gardens in the world. Arrive at the opening time, as one day is not enough to see everything. Download a free map (or pick up a free paper copy at the entrance) to orient yourself. Check the schedule of free walking tours at the information desk inside the main gift shop; there is usually a tour at 12:30 showcasing the most exciting seasonal stuff. Art galleries - [Marianne North Gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nALt1P7UtU) (permanent exhibition) and Shirley Sherwood Gallery (temporary exhibitions) - are a must. If the area is not rented out for an event, check out the Cambridge Cottage and Duke's Garden in front of it. Keep an eye out for events happening after 19:00 - spending time at Kew in the dark is truly magical.
* Isabella Plantation in Richmond Park - visit in late April/early May to catch rhododendrons in bloom (explore all 3 ponds). Also find the deer with huge antlers in Richmond Park.
* Regent's Canal. From Angel station it goes East to Victoria Park. From there you can continue North to Olympic Park or South to Limehouse. From Olympic Park you can continue North along the River Lee or South to Royal Observatory Greenwich (crossing under the Thames via Greenwich Foot Tunnel). In the opposite direction, from King's Cross, Regent's Canal goes West past Wembley, and you can follow it all the way to Slough or Kew Bridge. Both directions (East from Angel and West from King's Cross) are excellent for running and all-day walks.
* Huge Hampstead Heath park, extending into Highgate Wood in the North and Golders Hill Park in the West.
* Regent's Park - Primrose Hill (a perfect spot for a picnic and/or sunset watching), Queen Mary's Rose Gardens, etc.
* Hyde park, The Green Park, St James's Park.

### 6. Cuisines of the world (most places require booking ahead)

**African:**
* Tatale - contemporary Pan-African. Set menu with a vegan option.
* Chuku's (Nigerian Tapas) - loads of vegan options.
* Akoko - contemporary West African, in Soho. Tasting menu with a vegan option.

**Asian:**
* [Outcrop x AngloThai popup at 180 Strand](https://www.outcrop.social/#food) - this is likely short-term, so it's now or never.

**European:**
* Casa Fofó - sourdough-themed tasting menu focussed on being seasonal and local.
* Nest - tasting menu that celebrates British vegetables. The menu is vegetarian during their [vegetable season](https://www.nestfood.co.uk/menu) (usually in the summer), during their other seasons (chicken, lamb, game) asking to arrange a vegetarian option is just being a pain for them. But things might change.
* Silo London - zero-waste restaurant with a great tasting menu. They mill their own flour and make their own butter. They aim to eliminate food waste, so expect ice cream made from leftover sourdough bread.
* EDIT in Hackney.
* Gauthier - French tasting menu with steak, meat stews, cheesy pasta, etc. 100% vegan. Their 3D printed plant-protein steak is disturbingly animal-like.
* NOPI - by Ottolenghi.
* Ottolenghi (Islington) - by Ottolenghi.
* Tendril - a naughty vegan restaurant (with a bit of cheese). Both tasting menu and à la carte.

* Westerns Laundry - in Islington.
* Naifs - a cozy vegan restaurant in Peckham.

**Indian:**
* Rambutan - incredible Sri Lankan food.
* Kricket Soho - contemporary North Indian.

* Jam Delish - vegan Caribbean. 

**Middle-Eastern:**
* Bubala Spitalfields - one of the tastiest tasting menus. Vegan or vegetarian. I left feeling that I should have paid more given how much I loved it.

### 7. Just outside London

* [Seven sisters hike](https://www.moonhoneytravel.com/seven-sisters-cliffs-walk-seaford-to-eastbourne/) from Seaford train station to Eastbourne train station along the coast. Next on my to-do list: Eastbourne to Port Hastings walk, about 27km.
* [Downslink Bridleway](https://www.westsussex.gov.uk/leisure-recreation-and-community/walking-horse-riding-and-cycling/downs-link/) is a long-distance route (about 60km) following disused railway lines, perfect for running and cycling.
* Free in-person [tours of Amazon fulfilment centres](https://amazontours.com/uk/onsite/). Available locations vary, they are not always near London.

### Notes:

* Contactless payments with a bank card on all public transport within London and to/from three of London's airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, London City). You have to buy a separate ticket in advance to reach the other three airports (Luton, Stansted, Southend).
