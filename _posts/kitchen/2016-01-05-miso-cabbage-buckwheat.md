**Ingredients:**

* roasted buckwheat grain
* olive oil
* 1 cabbage (any sturdy, non-purple variety)
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 30g butter
* 30g miso
* 15g mirin
* 10g sugar
* 0.25 teaspoon of Kashmiri chilli powder
* pine nuts

**Methods:**
* Start boiling the buckwheat.
* Cover the bottom of a large cold pan with a thin layer of olive oil. Cut the cabbage into wedges, and arrange them on the pan in a single layer.
* Fry on high heat until the wedges start to brown. Flip them and wait for the other side to brown. If the cabbage is not yet tender, reduce the heat to medium-low, add a bit of water, and loosely cover with a lid (allowing steam to escape). Cook until tender.
* Meanwhile, prepare the sauce - soften the butter in a microwave, add miso, mirin, sugar and chilli powder. Mix everything together.
* Toast the pine nuts in a small pan.
* Once the cabbage is tender, keep the heat on medium-low, spoon the sauce over the cabbage and cook covered for 2min. Remove the lid and cook for another 2min or until the sauce starts to caramelise.
* Serve cabbage over buckwheat, topped with pine nuts.
