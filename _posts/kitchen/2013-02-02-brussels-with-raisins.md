**Ingredients:**

* 500g brussels sprouts
* olive oil
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 20g golden raisins
* distilled vinegar (or the cheapest one you've got)
* 20g red onion
* 20g parsley
* 20g balsamic vinegar

**Methods:**

* To pickle the raisins, place them in a small saucepan, cover generously with vinegar, and bring to a simmer. Take off the heat and let them plump up. (I usually make more raisins than I need and keep them in the fridge in a glass jar.)
* Defrost the Brussels sprouts in the microwave, if frozen.
* Cut brussels sprouts into halves.
* Cover the bottom of a large cold pan with a thin layer of olive oil. Arrange brussels sprout halves on the pan in a single layer, cut side down.
* Fry on high heat until they brown. Then turn off the heat and cover them with a lid to tenderise them with steam.
* While they are cooking, finely chop red onion and parsley. 
* Once ready, place brussels sprouts in a large bowl together with all the oil from the pan. Add balsamic vinegar, onion and parsley. Chop the pickled raisins and add them in. Mix everything together.
