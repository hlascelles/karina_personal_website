**Ingredients:**

* oyster mushrooms
* olive oil
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1 onion
* 10 garlic cloves
* 2 dried chillies 
* some fresh red chillies
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 4 teaspoons cumin powder
* 1 teaspoons coriander powder
* 15g tomato paste
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 700g white pre-cooked beans (white kidney beans, butter beans, etc.)
* 1 lemon
* 0.25 teaspoon salt

**Methods:**

* Preheat a large pan with olive oil. Chop the mushrooms and fry them until golden.
* Chop the onion into large chunks, peel the garlic cloves and chop big ones in half, chop both dry and fresh chillies into chunks. Place all of these into a small pan and add a lot of olive oil to cover them almost completely. Fry until garlic becomes golden on the outside and caramelised on the inside.
* Meanwhile, warm up the beans in the microwave. Add salt and juice of half a lemon. Handblender into a mash. Taste and adjust salt and acidity.
* Once the garlic is looking ready, take the small pan off the heat. Add cumin and coriander powder and tomato paste. Once the mixture has cooled down a bit, handblender it into a paste. Taste and adjust the spiciness with chilli powder. Mix in the fried mushrooms.
* Serve bean mash topped with spicy mushrooms.
