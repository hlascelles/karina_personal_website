  title: Run 21km in less than 100 minutes
  dates: Since Nov 2022
  text: "I've already learnt a lot from running. First, what gets measured influences our goal setting. I don't actually want to run 21km in less than 100 minutes, I want to be fit and have strong legs, but I can't measure that as easily as the number of minutes. Second, recovery (what happens between runs) matters no less than running itself, which got me thinking about how my off-work time influences my work. I wonder what else I'll learn on this journey."

  title: Never stop making friends
  dates: Since Feb 2020
  text: I've noticed that at a certain age people stop making new friends. I realised that some day I might lose my ability to strike up a conversation with a stranger and grow it into a friendship. To avoid that, I decided to meet at least a couple of new people every week. <a href="https://lunchclub.com/" target="_blank">Lunchclub</a> has been a huge help. Apart from making new friends, this has changed my perspective on the world.

  dates: Since Jun 2009
  text: I am a big city addict. I feel truly alive when I am in a big city. I love their idea density, their fast pace, and their excellence in food, <a href="/travel/street-art/">street art</a> and academic research. My goal is to visit all of the worldâ€™s biggest cities and the cities that are relatively small but are the biggest in their country or surrounding geographical area. See <a href="/travel/cities/">my current list of 200</a>.

  title: Become a superhost
  dates: May 2018 - Sep 2018
  text: Ever wondered what the superhost label means on AirBnB? At the moment in my life when I was living alone and had flexible work hours, I decided to find out! It was a fun journey of meeting people from different walks of life, chatting late into the night over many cups of tea, surprising my guests with the smell of pancakes in the morning. I got the superhost label!
