* [Serpentine Gallery](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/) - two building on either side of the Serpentine Bridge.
* Hyde park.
* St Columba's Church Of Scotland - very distinctive architecture.

<a name="kings-cross"></a> 

### 14. King's Cross 

* Known as the [Knowledge Quarter](https://www.knowledgequarter.london/) - The British Library, The British Museum, The Wellcome Trust, The Alan Turing Institute, Francis Crick Institute, UCL, SOAS, Royal College of Physicians, Google, Springer Nature, The Guardian (and many more) are all located here.
* [King's Cross Visitor Centre](https://www.kingscross.co.uk/visitor-centre) is a great place to start. The model of the neighbourhood gives you an overview of what there is to explore.
* Explore Pancras Square, Granary Square, Lewis Cubitt Square, Gasholder Park, Coal Drops Yard, St Pancras Station, etc. Follow Jack's [self-guided tour of the area](https://livinglondonhistory.com/the-hidden-history-of-kings-cross-a-walk/).

Pastries and sourdough from [Little Bread Pedlar](https://www.lbpedlar.com/) are great.
* Mestizo - awesome Mexican grocery shop near King's Cross. Their restaurant next door has an authentic menu (in writing), but the food lacks flavour and quality.
* [The Rooftop at The Standard](https://www.standardhotels.com/london/features/the-rooftop-bar-standard-london) - overpriced drinks are totally worth it on a warm sunny evening, as this bar has a unique view of the beautiful St Pancras Station.
* [Crypt Gallery](http://cryptgallery.org/) - an atmospheric gallery worth visiting, no matter what the exhibition is.

**Food and drink:**
* Dishoom King's Cross. I'm not sure why there is so much hype about this North Indian restaurant chain, but this specific location is truly special - a warehouse where goods and spices arrived from Bombay in the 1930s.
* Merkato - Ethiopian. Loads of vegan options.
* Indian Lounge - not the best food, but super convenient location and no booking required.

<a name="liverpool-street"></a>

* The area around Old Street Station, nicknamed "Silicon Roundabout", has a fun origin story that [started with a throwaway joke in 2008 and became UK government's policy in 2010](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/silicon-roundabout-tech-city-property).
* La Fauxmagerie - London's first vegan cheese shop.

**Architecture:**

* Don't miss the great view of Liverpool Street Station from the Exchange Square.
* St Paul's cathedral.
* Paternoster Square, including Temple Bar London - a renovated (and relocated) City of London gateway from the 1600s. There used to be 10 of them (Aldgate, Moorgate, etc.), this is the only one that survived.

**Food and drink:**
* Bubala Spitalfields - one of the tastiest tasting menus, Middle Eastern. Vegan or vegetarian. I left feeling that I should have paid more given how much I loved it.
* Dosa World - authentic South Indian food.

**Cocktails:** The Gobpsy (Tue-Fri only; beneath a barber shop), City of London Distillery & Bar (gin-centric cocktails).

<a name="london-bridge"></a> 

### 16. London Bridge 

* [Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern) and their [Lates](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/tate-modern-lates). Worth a visit even if you don't like modern art, as it is located in the former Bankside Power Station, which operated until 1981.

<a name="richmond"></a> 

### 18. Richmond 

* [Kew Gardens](https://www.kew.org/kew-gardens/whats-on) - one of the best botanical gardens in the world. Arrive at the opening time, as one day is not enough to see everything. Download a free map (or pick up a free paper copy at the entrance) to orient yourself. Check the schedule of free walking tours at the information desk inside the main gift shop; there is usually a tour at 12:30 showcasing the most exciting seasonal stuff. Art galleries - [Marianne North Gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nALt1P7UtU) (permanent exhibition) and Shirley Sherwood Gallery (temporary exhibitions) - are a must. If the area is not rented out for an event, check out the Cambridge Cottage and Duke's Garden in front of it. Keep an eye out for events happening after 19:00 - spending time at Kew in the dark is truly magical.

* Columbia Road Flower Market (Sundays).
* [Photobookcafe](https://www.photobookcafe.co.uk/) - a perfect place for a non-alcoholic drinks meeting in the evening.

**Food:**
* Nest - tasting menu that celebrates British vegetables. The menu is vegetarian during their [vegetable season](https://www.nestfood.co.uk/menu) (usually in the summer), during their other seasons (chicken, lamb, game) asking to arrange a vegetarian option is just being a pain for them. But things might change. Modern European.

<a name="soho"></a>
