**Ingredients:**

* 1 butternut squash
* olive oil
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 600g Lacinato kale, or any flat leaf variety
* 30g olive oil
* 15g balsamic vinegar
* 0.5 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 2 cooking apples (Bramley or similar)
* pumpkin seeds
* 1 small red onion

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 200C.
* Peel the butternut squash, chop it into cubes, coat them in olive oil. Bake until tender and starting to char on the corners, about 40min.
* Meanwhile, remove the stems from the kale. Wash and dry the kale. Chop it into bite size pieces.
* Make the dressing - place olive oil, vinegar, mustard and salt in a small glass jar. Close the lid and shake violently.
* Mix the kale with the dressing by hand, massage it well.
* Peel the apples, chop them into cubes.
* Pre-heat a large frying pan with some olive oil. Add in the apple cubes and let them fry until they turn golden brown. Stir and repeat a couple of times until you have many brown sides and the apples are tender.
* Meanwhile, toast pumpkin seeds in a small clean frying pan.
* Finely chop a red onion and add it to the kale.
* Once the butternut squash is ready, mix it in with kale and pumpkin seeds.
* Serve the salad in individual plates topped with fried apple cubes.
