**Ingredients:**

* 200g sugar
* 70g butter
* 140g double cream
* a pinch of smoked salt 

**Methods:**

* Prepare the correct amount of cream. Prepare the correct amount of butter, cut it into chunks.
* Place the sugar into a saucepan that looks too large for the amount of sugar. Heat over medium high heat until it dissolves and starts to brown. 
* Once it starts to brown, lower the heat and swirl the pot occasionally to facilitate even browning. 
* Once it starts to foam, use the spoon to see what colour is your caramel under the foam. 
* Once it is the colour of black tea, take it off the heat. Immediately add all the butter and whisk until the butter melts completely. The caramel will bubble up ferociously. Add the cream and whisk until fully incorporated.
* Stir in the salt. If you get any lumps, place it back over low heat until everything melts again. 
* Let it cool completely. Then taste and adjust the salt. Keep in a jar in the fridge.

**Notes:** serve as a dip for oven roasted walnuts.
