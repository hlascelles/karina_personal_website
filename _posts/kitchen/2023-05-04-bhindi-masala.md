**Ingredients:**

* about 300g okra
* coconut oil
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1-2 onions
* a small piece of ginger
* 2 garlic cloves
* 2-4 tomatoes
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
<nbsp></nbsp>
* wholegrain rice

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the rice.
* Make sure your okra is completely dry. Chop off the stem ends. Chop off the tip ends of large okras (they are very fibrous). Chop okra into large bite-size pieces.
* Heat the pan with a generous amount of coconut oil.
* Saute okra in the pan, stirring often. Observe how slimy goo forms between pieces. Keep sauteing until the slimy goo disappears completely (5-10 min). 
* Meanwhile, finely chop onions, ginger and tomatoes.
* Once okra is no longer slimy, set it aside.
* To the same, now empty, pan add more oil and cumin seeds. 
* Once the cumin seeds start to sputter, add onions and saute until turning golden but not yet brown.
* Add finely chopped ginger, and use a garlic press to add garlic cloves directly into the pan. Saute until smells really good.
* Add finely chopped tomatoes and salt. Saute until tomatoes change colour and turn mushy. 
* Add dry spices (garam masala, ground coriander, chilli powder, ground turmeric), mix them in well. Saute until it smells really good.
* Add a splash of water to bring out the flavour of the spices. 
* Once most of the water has evaporated, transfer to a saucepan. Taste to adjust salt and spiciness levels.
* Stir in okra, put on the lid and cook on low heat until you start smelling the okra. Check that the okra is tender.
* Serve with rice.
