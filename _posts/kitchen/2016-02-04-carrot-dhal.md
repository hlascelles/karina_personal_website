**Ingredients:**

* 1 red onion
* 1 green chilli
* 2 garlic cloves
* a small piece of ginger
* 1 teaspoon cumin powder
* 1 teaspoon coriander powder
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon powder
* 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
<nbsp></nbsp>
* coconut oil
* 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
* 400g can of coconut milk
* 200g red lentils
* 6 carrots
* 2 large handfuls of spinach
* 1 lemon
<nbsp></nbsp>
* wholegrain rice
* yoghurt

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the rice.
* Very roughly chop onions, chillies, garlic and ginger. No need to peel the ginger.
* Place them into a bowl and add all the dry spices (garam masala, chilli, salt, cumin, turmeric). Hand blender this into paste.
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat a bit of coconut oil. Add mustard seeds and wait until they start to sputter. Add the curry paste and fry for a couple of minutes, until it smells really good.
* Add coconut milk, lentils and 600g of water.
* While the lentils are cooking, grate the carrots and add them in.
* Once lentils are cooked, take off the heat. Stir in spinach and the juice of the lemon.
* Serve in a bowl, topped with rice and yoghurt.
