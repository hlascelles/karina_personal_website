**Ingredients:**

* 3 red bell pepper
* 50g almonds
* 130g roasted buckwheat grain
* 1 cauliflower
* olive oil
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 10g red onion
* 1 garlic clove (about 10g)
* 25g olive oil
* 25g red wine vinegar
* 1 teaspoon Chipotle chilli powder (or a mix of smoked paprika and Kashmiri chilli powder)
* 0.25 teaspoon salt

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 200C.
* Cut each bell pepper into 3 or 4 flat sides, depending on their shapes. Place them near the top of the oven, turn on the broiler and bake until the skins turn inedibly black.
* Toast the almonds in the oven on a separate tray.
* Start boiling the buckwheat in cold water.
* Cut the cauliflower into large florets. Then cut each floret in half to maximize the flat surface area.
* Lightly cover the bottom of a large frying pan with olive oil and arrange the cauliflower cut side down. Fry on high heat until they turn golden brown on one side. Flip them, loosely cover with a lid (allowing steam to escape) and turn off the heat. Let them steam until tender.
* Once the bell pepper skin looks inedibly black, remove the peppers from the oven, place them in a bowl and cover with a plate/lid to steam their skins off. 
* In a bowl place roughly chopped red onion, almonds, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, chilli/paprika powder and salt.
* Remove most of the skins from the bell peppers. It should be super easy, apart from the fact that they are a bit too warm to touch.
* Add about 200g of roasted bell peppers into the bowl with other sauce ingredients. Handblender everything into a sauce.
* Serve the sauce topped with cauliflower, and buckwheat on the side.
