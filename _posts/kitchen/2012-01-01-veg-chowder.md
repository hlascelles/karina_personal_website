**Ingredients:**

* olive oil
* 1 onion
* 3 cloves garlic
* 230g brussels sprouts 
* 400g can coconut cream
* 6 teaspoons nutritional yeast flakes
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 160g frozen corn
* 400g potatoes
* 400g cauliflower
* 1 courgette
* 2 red chillies
* 1 lemon

**Methods:**

* Heat the olive oil in a large heavy bottom pot. Finely chop an onion and garlic, and saute them.
* Defrost the Brussels sprouts in the microwave, if frozen. Finely chop them and add them to the pot.
* Once the sprouts turn vibrant green, add the coconut cream and about twice as much water. Add yeast flakes, salt and frozen corn.
* Chop potatoes into bite size pieces and add them in.
* After 5 minutes add the cauliflower and courgette.
* Finely slice some red chillies and add them in.
* Once potatoes are tender, spoon 25% of the soup into a bowl, seeking out potatoes and chillies, and avoiding courgettes.
* Handblender the contents of the bowl and reunite it with the rest of the soup. 
* Taste and adjust the salt and acidity (lemon juice) levels.
* Serve topped with black pepper.
