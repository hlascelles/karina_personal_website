**Ingredients:**

* 250g carrots (2 or 3)
* 300g onions (3 or 4)
* 300g oyster mushrooms
* 350g tomatoes (3 or 4)
* 4 big garlic cloves
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 100g olive oil
* 70g miso paste
* 40g rose harissa
* 100g tomato paste
* 90g soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons of cumin seeds
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 60g dried porcini mushrooms
* 100g red wine
* 160g coconut cream
* 180g green lentils
* 100g pearl barley
* black pepper
<nbsp></nbsp>
* polenta

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 190C.
* Very finely chop carrots, onions, oyster mushrooms and tomatoes. Put them all into a 3L ceramic lasagna tray.
* Use a garlic press to add garlic cloves directly into the vegetables.
* Mix the next 6 ingredients (oil, miso paste, harissa, tomato paste, soy sauce and cumin seeds).
* Add the oil mixture to the tray and mix everything.
* Bake for 40 minutes, stirring halfway through.
* Meanwhile, soak the dried mushrooms in 1 litre of boiling water (we will use this water). Mix red wine and coconut cream.
* Once the 40 minutes are almost up, pick out the now soaked mushrooms and chop them.
* Remove the tray from the oven to add lentils, barley and soaked mushrooms. Pour over the red wine and coconut cream mixture. Add a very generous grind of black pepper. Mix everything.
* Add dried mushroom soaking liquid. Add more water if there is space left in the tray.
* Cover the tray tightly with aluminum foil, and return it to the oven.
* Decrease the oven temperature to 180C. Bake for another 40 minutes. Check halfway through and add more water if needed.
* Remove the foil and bake for a final 5 minutes.
* Set aside to rest for at least 15 minutes or overnight.
* Meanwhile make polenta - boil 4 cups of water, whisk 1 cup of polenta into the boiling water and cook for 1 minute.
* Serve the ragu with polenta.
