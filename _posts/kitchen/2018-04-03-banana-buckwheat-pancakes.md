* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 30g butter
* 2 very ripe bananas
* 200g milk
* 0.5 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Methods:**

* Melt the butter and let it cool down a bit.
* Mix all the dry ingredients (flour, ground seeds, baking powder, cinnamon and salt).
* Mash bananas with a fork.
* Add bananas to the flour mixture, mix until combined. Add milk, melted butter and vanilla extract, and mix until combined.
* Spoon small dollops of batter on a hot non-stick pan. They will expand, so do keep them small and spaced out. Flip as soon as the bottom sides are brown.
