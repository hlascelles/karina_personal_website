**Ingredients:**

* 100g walnut
* 200g carrots
* olive oil
* butter
* 200g pasta
* salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1.5 teaspoon of chipotle chilli powder (or a mix of smoked paprika and Kashmiri chilli powders)
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 15g garlic
* 50g red onion
* 30g vinegar (half-half balsamic and red wine vinegar)
* 10g olive oil
<nbsp></nbsp>
* Pecorino style cheese
* parsley
* 20g butter

**Methods:**

* Toast the walnuts in a small pan or in the oven.
* Meanwhile, chop the carrots into thick coins.
* Preheat the pan, add a generous splash of olive oil and a blob of butter, let the butter melt. Brown the carrots on both sides.
* Meanwhile, start boiling the pasta in salty water.
* When the carrots are almost ready, add spices (chipotle chilli or smoked paprika and Kashmiri chilli) and salt. Add in garlic through a garlic press. Mix everything, cook for 1min and take off the heat.
* Very roughly chop walnuts and red onion. Place in a bowl and add everything from the frying pan, vinegar(s) and 10g of olive oil. Handblender everything together. 
* Grate the Pecorino cheese. Finely chop the parsley.
* Once ready, drain the pasta over a mug (to reserve the cooking liquid). Add it into the carrots, add 20g of butter and mix everything together. Add some pasta cooking water if needed. Add the cheese and mix again. 
* Serve topped with parsley.

**Notes:** If your carrots come with fresh leaves, you don't need parsley. Just chop the leaves finely and add them into the bowl together with the walnuts prior to handblendering everything together.
