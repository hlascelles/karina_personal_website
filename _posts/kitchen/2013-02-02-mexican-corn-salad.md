* Meanwhile, make the dressing - zest a lime; in a large bowl mix yoghurt with the juice of a lime, lime zest, salt and some black pepper.
* Once the corn is ready, mix it in with the dressing. In the same, now empty, pan add Kashmiri chilli powder to a bit of olive oil. Use the garlic press to add the cloves to the pan. Fry for 1min and add to the salad.
