**Ingredients:**

* 230g butter 
* 330g dark 70%+ chocolate 
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 6 eggs
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 60g buttermilk / kefir
* 185g  sugar
* 4 teaspoons cornstarch (about 10g)
* 0.75 teaspoons salt 
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract (10g)
* 1 tablespoon instant coffee (about 5g)
<nbsp></nbsp>
* hazelnuts

**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 130C. Grease a 23cm loose-bottomed round cake tin with butter.
* In a saucepan over medium heat, add butter cut into chunks and chocolate broken into squares. Stir frequently until fully melted, and remove from heat.
* Separate egg whites from egg yolks into two large bowls.
* Into the yolks, add buttermilk, sugar, cornstarch, salt, vanilla, coffee and melted chocolate. Mix well.
* Whip egg whites to soft peaks.
* Fold whipped egg whites into the cake mix. 
* Transfer into the greased cake tin and bake for about 40min at 130C. When you take it out of the oven, it should still be slightly jiggly in the center.
* Toast hazelnuts in the oven at 180C.
* Refrigerate the cake overnight. Then serve with hazelnuts.
