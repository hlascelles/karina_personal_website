**Ingredients:**

* Lion's mane mushrooms
* butter
* salt
* black pepper

**Methods:**

* Tear Lion's mane mushrooms into uniform size shreds with your hands. 
* Pre-heat a large pan. Melt a generous amount of butter in the pan. Scatter the mushroom shreds in a single layer and press them down with a spatula or something heavier. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Don't bother them until they are golden brown on one side, at which point flip them, press them down into the pan and let them brown on the other side undisturbed. Takes about 10 min total.

**Notes:** Don't let the unusual shape of this mushroom stop you - it is one of the most delicious mushrooms in the world.
