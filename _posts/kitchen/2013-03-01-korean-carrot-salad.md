**Ingredients:**

* 300g carrots
* 30g sunflower oil
* 1 red onion (about 80g)
* 20g garlic cloves
* 6 teaspoons white vinegar
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 15g sugar (3 teaspoons)
* 1 teaspoon coriander powder
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika powder
* 0.5 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 0.5 teaspoon salt
* 3g black pepper (about 1 teaspoon)



**Methods:**
* Shred the carrots with a Julienne peeler.
* Finely chop the onion. Peel the garlic.
* Heat the oil in a small pan. When hot, add onions and cook them on high heat until they turn golden.
* Meanwhile, prepare the spice mix - coriander, paprika, chilli, salt, sugar and freshly cracked black pepper.
* Once the onions start to turn golden, use the garlic press to add garlic directly into the pan.
* Once you can smell the garlic, add the spice mix and stir. Take off the heat.
* Pour the hot contents of the pan over carrots. Add the vinegar. Mix with a spoon. Once the carrots have cooled down the oil, use your hands to give them a very good massage. 
* Transfer into a closed container and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
