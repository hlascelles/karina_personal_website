**Ingredients:**

* 70g polenta
* 65g flour
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 tablespoon dark Muscovado sugar
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 20g butter
* 160g buttermilk/kefir
* 1 egg
* 70g corn kernels (fresh or frozen)
<nbsp></nbsp>
* tomatoes
* garlic
* salt
* olive oil
* various mushrooms
* black pepper
* mozzarella


**Methods:**

* Preheat the oven to 180C.
* Place tomatoes onto a baking tray - leave small ones whole and cut the bigger ones to match the size. Peal a whole garlic bulb and add whole cloves to the tomatoes. Add salt and olive oil, mix everything and arrange into a single layer. Bake in the oven until tomato skins just start to blacken.
* Heat olive oil in a large frying pan. Chop mushrooms and fry until golden on all sides. Season with black pepper.
* Melt the butter and let it cool down a bit.
* Mix all the dry ingredients for the pancakes (polenta, flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda and sugar).
* Separately whisk together all the wet ingredients for the pancakes (buttermilk/kefir, egg, corn kernels and melted butter). 
* Pre-heat a non-stick pan. When you are ready to start frying, stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Do not overmix. Spoon small dollops of batter on a hot pan. They will expand, so do keep them small and spaced out. Flip as soon as the bottom sides are brown, while the top is still liquid.
* Meanwhile, take the tomatoes out of the oven and handblender the contents of the baking tray into a sauce. Shred the mozzarella. 
* Serve pancakes with fried mushrooms, tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella.
