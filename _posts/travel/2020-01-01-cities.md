I am a big city addict. 
I feel truly alive when I am in a big city. 
I love their idea density, their fast pace, and their excellence in food, [street art](/travel/street-art/) and academic research.


My goal is to visit all of the world's biggest cities and the cities that are relatively small but are the biggest in their country or surrounding geographical area. 
Below is my current list of 200; this list is constantly evolving based on my travels and on the new things I learn about the world. 
The population data is based on the <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities" target="_blank">World City Populations (2020)</a>, it is only correct to the order of magnitude. 

Progress on my goal? 59 out of 200.

[//]: # Maybe: Ahmedabad, India, 9 million, 5+ million, 7th biggest; Surat, India, 8 million, 5+ million, 8th biggest; Pune, India, 7 million, 5+ million, 9th biggest; Medellin, Colombia, 4 million, 2nd biggest; Gibraltar, Austin, Seattle, Houston, Geneva
