**Ingredients:**

* coconut oil
* 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
* 30g white urad dal (split)
* 1 red onion
* 2 green chillies
* a sprig of curry leaves
* 2 garlic cloves
* 2 beetroots (about 300g)
* 0.25 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
* 50g shredded coconut (the finest one)
<nbsp></nbsp>
* wholegrain rice
* yoghurt

**Methods:**

* Soak coconut in 100g of hot water.
* Start boiling the rice.
* Grate the beetroots. Finely dice the onions.
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat a bit of coconut oil. Add mustard seeds and urad dal, wait until mustard seeds start to sputter and dal turns golden.
* Add onion and saute until it starts to turn golden. 
* Finely chop the green chillies and add them in. Add curry leaves. Use the garlic press to add garlic directly into the pot.
* Once it smells really good, add beetroots, turmeric powder, salt and coconut with the soaking liquid. Add 100g of water. Reduce the heat and cook under a lid.
* Once the beetroot is tender, evaporate any excess water.
* Serve with rice and yoghurt.

**Notes:** works equally well with carrots or sturdy cabbage instead of beetroots.
