**Ingredients:**

* wholegrain rice
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1 red onion (about 80g)
* 3 garlic cloves (about 10g)
* a piece of ginger (about 20g)
* green chillies
* 2 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon cumin powder
* 0.5 teaspoon salt
* 0.25 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 0.25 teaspoon turmeric powder
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 1 tomato (about 300g)
* coconut oil
* 450g paneer
* 750g spinach
* 50g double cream

**Methods:**

* Start boiling the rice.
* Very roughly chop onions, chillies, garlic and ginger. No need to peel the ginger.
* Place them into a bowl and add all the dry spices (garam masala, chilli, salt, cumin, turmeric). Hand blender this into paste.
* Finely chop the tomato.
* In a heavy bottom pot, heat a bit of coconut oil. Add the curry paste and fry for a couple of minutes, until it smells really good. Once it starts sticking to the bottom of the pot, add the tomato. Let it simmer on low heat.
* Prepare a pot of salted boiling water and a bowl of ice water. Blanch the spinach in boiling water and immediately transfer it into the ice water (to preserve its vibrant colour).
* Heat a non-stick pan with coconut oil. Cube the paneer and fry it until golden on most sides.
* Meanwhile, drain and handblender the spinach. Add it to the pot and wait for the temperature to come back up.
* Add cream and wait for the temperature to come back up. Taste and adjust for salt and spice levels.
* Mix in the paneer cubes. Serve with rice.
