**Ingredients:**

* 160g cashews
* 200g Medjool dates
* 0.25 teaspoon salt
<nbsp></nbsp>
* 30g pistachios
* 3 egg yolks
* 84g butter
* 5 [grapefruits](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/grapefruit-juice-and-some-drugs-dont-mix)
* 120g sugar
* 27g cornstarch

**Methods:**

* Finely chop the cashews. Pit the dates, and finely chop them. Mix these two ingredients by hand, add the salt and keep mixing. Spread it on the bottom of a springform cake tin (23cm diameter or less). (None of my kitchen appliances can deal with combining dates and cashews into a paste, if your appliances can - lucky you!)
* Very lightly roast pistachios in a small frying pan.
* Prepare 3 egg yolks in a glass bowl, and place it in a fridge. 
* Cube the butter and set aside.
* Juice the grapefruits and strain the juice.
* In a saucepan whisk together sugar and cornstarch. Add 390g of grapefruit juice and [drink the rest of the juice](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/grapefruit-juice-and-some-drugs-dont-mix). Place the saucepan over medium heat and keep whisking until everything is dissolved. 
* Keep whisking frequently until the mixture thickens, changes colour and starts to bubble. 
* Grab the cold bowl with egg yolks from the fridge. Pour small amounts of the grapefruit mixture onto the sides of the egg yolk bowl to cool the mixture before it meets the yolks, to avoid making an omelette. Keep adding the mixture a bit at a time and whisking it into the yolks. Once half of the grapefruit mixture is mixed with the yolks, return everything back into the saucepan. 
* Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly until the mixture starts to bubble. Cook and whisk for 2 more minutes. Remove from the heat, add in the butter and whisk until all of it melts in. Pour the mixture on top of the cashew and date base. 
* Chop the pistachios, while giving the tart a moment to settle, and top the tart with pistachios.
* Loosely cover the tart and let it set in the fridge, takes about 4 hours.
